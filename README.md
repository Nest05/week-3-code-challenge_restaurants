# week-3-code-challenge_restaurants
A challenge solved by Python - sqlalchemy

## description

Deliverables
Write the following methods in the classes. Feel free to build out any helper methods if needed.

Database.
Before working on the rest of the deliverables, you will need to create all tables.

- A `Review` belongs to a `Restaurant`, and a `Review` also belongs to a  `Customer`.  In your script, create any columns your `reviews` table will

 need to establish these relationships.

The `reviews` table should also have:  - A `star_rating` column that stores an integer.

After creating the `reviews` table , use the `main.py` file to create instances of all your classes so you can test your code.

**Once you've set up your tables**, work on building out the following deliverables.

Object Relationship Methods
Use cursor query methods where appropriate.

Review
- `Review customer()`

 - should return the `Customer` instance for this review

- `Review restaurant()`

 - should return the `Restaurant` instance for this review

Restaurant
- `Restaurant reviews()`

 - returns a collection of all the reviews for the `Restaurant`

- `Restaurant customers()`

 - returns a collection of all the customers who reviewed the `Restaurant`

Customer
- `Customer reviews()`

 - should return a collection of all the reviews that the `Customer` has left

- `Customer restaurants()`

 - should return a collection of all the restaurants that the `Customer` has reviewed

 Check that these methods work before proceeding.

Aggregate and Relationship Methods
Customer
- `Customer full_name()`

 - returns the full name of the customer, with the first name and the last name  concatenated, Western style.

- `Customer favorite_restaurant()`

 - returns the restaurant instance that has the highest star rating from this customer

- `Customer add_review(restaurant, rating)`

 - takes a `restaurant` (an instance of the `Restaurant` class) and a rating

 - creates a new review for the restaurant with the given `restaurant_id`

- `Customer delete_reviews(restaurant)`

 - takes a `restaurant` (an instance of the `Restaurant` class) and

 - removes **all** their reviews for this restaurant

 - you will have to delete rows from the `reviews` table to get this to work!

 

Review
- `Review full_review()`

 - should return a string formatted as follows:
Review for {insert restaurant name} by {insert customer's full name}: {insert review star_rating} stars.

Restaurant
- `Restaurant fanciest(), this method should be a class method`

- returns _one_ restaurant instance for the restaurant that has the highest   price

- `Restaurant all_reviews()`

- should return a list of strings with all the reviews for this restaurant

  formatted as follows:

[

"Review for {insert restaurant name} by {insert customer's full name}: {insert review star_rating} stars.",

"Review for {insert restaurant name} by {insert customer's full name}: {insert review star_rating} stars.",

]
